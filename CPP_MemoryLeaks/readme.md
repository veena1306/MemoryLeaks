How New works internally :- 

When we write ï¿½
  int *ptr = new int{5};   => initialises the constructor
             this new internally calls the function : void *operator new(size_t size){
                                                     // allocate memory
                                                    } this function is already implemented in the library.
                                                    // returns the memory address.
                                                    
                                                    
  =>  failures for new :- 

    -> new throws an exception on failure.
    -> it throws an exception of bad_alloc(default behaviour).
    -> it calls a function set by set_new_handler function.
    -> it returns NULL if nothrow version of new is used.
    
    
  ==> non- throwing new :- 
        
    -> this doesn't throw an exception if fails, but returns an nullptr.
    -> it may be usefull when its not possible to catch an exception.
    -> you may be calling c++ code from c code, in such casses its not possible to catch an exception.
    -> an application or library compiled with different compilers calls each others code that may throw exception. There is no guarantee that such exception can be caught by  either application & library.
    
    
  => placement New :- 
  
      -> allocates memory at the address specified by the user.
      -> used for creating objects at designated memory locations.
            -> useful in embedded devices where objects may be stored at known locations.
            -> memory pooling
     -> you may need to call delete explicitly for objects that have been created by placement new.
     -> standard library uses placement new in allocators.
     
   Syntax:   int *ptr = new(<memory_address>)Type{};
